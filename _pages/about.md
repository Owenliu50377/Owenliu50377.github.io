🏫 I am a second-year student graduate student (Spatial Data Science) at the University of Southern California.

🏫 I graduated (Data Science and Big Data Technology) from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Shenzhen in 2023.

# Current Activities

**Key words: Machine learning, Financial Engineering, AI Generated Content**


📚 I am currently working as a research assistant in the Department of Economics at USC. And also I am open to internships in the Artificial Intelligence field.


📚 At the same time, I am also wokring in China Mobile International Research Institute as a Gernerative AI Engineer. The work comprising building long text generation model similar to **STORM** and building Text2SQL Agent similar to **Vanna**.

# Selected Experience

## 💻 Generative AI Engineer at China Mobile International Research Institute (2024.06 - Present)


## 📕 Research Assistant at University of Southern California (2024.4 - Present)
I am now working in the Department of Economics at USC

+ Applied multiple machine/deep learning algorithms including XGboosting, Attention (Transformers), NNM based on Pytroch etc. to predict travel time based on travel mode and distances.

## 📕 Research Assistant at Shenzhen Research Institution of Big Data (2022.11 ~ 2023.05)

I used to be a research assistant concentrating on Operation Research Applications.

+ Developed enhanced algorithms to solve spatial operational problems and provided distribution strategies.
+ Utilized the RNN model to provide strategies for a certain FMCG company to price their merchandises next seasons. 
+ Implemented a variable neighborhood search sim-heuristic algorithm to solve the multi-period inventory routing problem under stochastic spatial distribution and demands in 30 minutes on small scale
+ Constructed a distributed decision model based on the stochastic demands, fulfilling regular deliveries on the service level and tracking inventory with a preset standard
+ Made electricity grid distribution strategy based on the spatial electricity data of the specific region
+ Implemented a branch and bound algorithm based on the Hungarian method in combination with a simplex method for complex networks to minimize the costs of a project to build a decision model for the project managers, decreasing the time cost by around 15%

## 💻 AI Engineer Intern at ByteDance Ltd. (2022.05 ~ 2022.06)
I worked in Bytedance as AI Engineer Internship in Beijing in 2022 and developed and refined AI algorithms and applied them in real-world situations

+ Implemented handwritten digits recognition with TensorFlow, the Sequential model in Keras, and a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN)
+ Identified illegal messages on given websites with a Naive Bayes classifier achieving around 75% accuracy
+ Performed exploratory data analysis of UCI’s Horse Colic Data Set, and predicted the survival or death of horses based on their medical conditions with Adaboost, achieving high accuracy


## 💻 DataBase Engineer Intern at ZZNode Technology (2022.03 ~ 2022.05)

I worked in Bytedance as Database Engineer Internship in ZZNode in 2022.
+ Managed entities in database, conducted some data analysis based on SQL, and fulfilled internal requests through a self-built database with SQL.
+ Built with SQL and Python (UI) a database of bridges in the US with over 760,000 entries and 200 attributes of technical and maintenance details
+ Conducted with Graphviz (for visualization) exploratory data analysis via the classification and regression tree (CART) model, K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the durability and economic efficiency of bridges in question
+ Conducted the Chi-Square test to test the independence among attributes
+ Provided Python scripts to process the business queries automatically with the MySQL to Python connector


# Recent Projects


## NVIDIA 10th Sky Hackathon Contest (Rank 11/50)

"Building an Intelligent Conversational Robot Based on RAG Technology Innovation". I primarily used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology and combined it with NVIDIA's SDK tools to design and build conversational bots in the investment report analysis field. This model achieved the goal of quick responding multi-modally and accurate extraction.

## China Merchandise Bank Fintech Contest (Rank 140/2000)

Built an Intelligent Agent for investment research based on LangChain, RAG and LLM （OpenAI Embeddings） to accomplish tasks such as parsing and understanding fund announcement data from separate report files. This Agent is able to answer the users' question muiltimodelly such as plot figures.

## UBS Financial Engineering Contest

My lane is about building models (e.g., AI models) that can accurately and efficiently predict the risk exposure of Range Accrual Note based on the characteristics of the simulated product, historical risk factor data, and the market environment provided.

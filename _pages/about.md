üè´ I am a second-year student graduate student (Spatial Data Science) at the University of Southern California.

üè´ I graduated (Data Science and Big Data Technology) from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Shenzhen in 2023.

# Current Activities

**Key words: Machine learning, Financial Engineering, AI Generated Content**

+ I am working towards the Mixture Neural Network for my RA position at USC.
+ I am also participating in the stock pitch competition of financial engineering by the UBS by the end of May. My lane is about building models (e.g., AI models) that can accurately and efficiently predict the risk exposure of Range Accrual Note based on the characteristics of the simulated product, historical risk factor data, and the market environment provided.
+ I am also a member of the AIGC contest of Deloitte, to explore how AIGC will be applied in the financial industry such as insurance and bank.

üìö I am currently working as a research assistant in the Department of Economics at USC. And also I am open to seeking an internship in the Artificial Intelligence field.


# Selected Experience

## üìï Research Assistant at University of Southern California (2024.4 - Present)
I am now working in the Department of Economics at USC

+ Applied multiple machine/deep learning algorithms including XGboosting, Attention (Transformers), NNM based on Pytroch etc. to predict travel time based on travel mode and distances.

## üìï Research Assistant at Shenzhen Research Institution of Big Data (2022.11 ~ 2023.05)

I used to be a research assistant concentrating on Operation Research Applications.

+ Developed enhanced algorithms to solve spatial operational problems and provided distribution strategies.
+ Implemented a variable neighborhood search sim-heuristic algorithm to solve the multi-period inventory routing problem under stochastic spatial distribution and demands in 30 minutes on small scale
+ Constructed a distributed decision model based on the stochastic demands, fulfilling regular deliveries on the service level and tracking inventory with a preset standard
+ Made electricity grid distribution strategy based on the spatial electricity data of the specific region
+ Implemented a branch and bound algorithm based on the Hungarian method in combination with a simplex method for complex networks to minimize the costs of a project to build a decision model for the project managers, decreasing the time cost by around 15%

## üíª AI Engineer Intern at ByteDance Ltd. (2022.05 ~ 2022.06)
I worked in Bytedance as AI Engineer Internship in Beijing in 2022 and developed and refined AI algorithms and applied them in real-world situations

+ Built an Intelligent Agent for investment research based on LangChain, RAG and LLM to accomplish tasks such as parsing and understanding fund announcement data, answering user questions by multi-modality.
+ Implemented handwritten digits recognition with TensorFlow, the Sequential model in Keras, and a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN)
+ Identified illegal messages on given websites with a Naive Bayes classifier achieving around 75% accuracy
+ Performed exploratory data analysis of UCI‚Äôs Horse Colic Data Set, and predicted the survival or death of horses based on their medical conditions with Adaboost, achieving high accuracy


## üíª DataBase Engineer Intern at ZZNode Technology (2022.03 ~ 2022.05)

I worked in Bytedance as Database Engineer Internship in ZZNode in 2022.
+ Managed entities in database, conducted some data analysis based on SQL, and fulfilled internal requests through a self-built database with SQL.
+ Built with SQL and Python (UI) a database of bridges in the US with over 760,000 entries and 200 attributes of technical and maintenance details
+ Conducted with Graphviz (for visualization) exploratory data analysis via the classification and regression tree (CART) model, K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the durability and economic efficiency of bridges in question
+ Conducted the Chi-Square test to test the independence among attributes
+ Provided Python scripts to process the business queries automatically with the MySQL to Python connector
